# Unlocked Tickrate

Quite self-explanatory, bypass forced tickrate in TF2 by hooking in Server methods.

## Usage

Download latest release from https://github.com/ldesgoui/mms-unlocked-tickrate/releases to steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2 Dedicated Server/tf and unzip it.
Put `-tickrate <desired tickrate>` in your launch options for your SrcDS server.
**Reload the map with `changelevel <map>`**.
Check if it loaded properly with `rcon meta list` and `net_graph 5` (will show sv: <tickrate>)

## Suggested config

```
sv_minrate <20000 * tickrate * 0.015>
sv_maxrate <80000 * tickrate * 0.015>
sv_minupdaterate <tickrate>
sv_mincmdrate <tickrate>
sv_maxupdaterate <tickrate>
sv_maxcmdrate <tickrate>
```

## Compiling

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ldesgoui/mms-unlocked-tickrate --recursive
cd mms-unlocked-tickrate
make release
ls *.zip
```
